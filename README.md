![GoAlert js dependencies](goalert.png)

This was a fun exercise in dependency visualization in a large React codebase. The GUI does allow for zooming in, but ultimately, the most well-connected nodes are visually too noisy to be of much help. If I were to do this again, I would scale the node diameter for neighbor count and the color for cardinality.
